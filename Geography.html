    <h2>The Geography Of Switzerland</h2>   

    <h3>Dimensions</h3> 
    <p>Area: 41285 km² (approx. 10'201'746 acres or 15'940 square miles).</p>
    <p>Boundary: 1858 km (1150 miles).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Germany: 346 km (215 miles)</li>
        <li>France: 572 km (355 miles)</li>
        <li>Italy: 734 km (456 miles)</li>
        <li>Austria: 165 km (103 miles)</li>
        <li>Liechtenstein: 41 km (25 miles)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Highest elevation: Mount Monte Rosa ("Dufourspitze"), 4634 m.a.s (15200 feet).</p>
    <p>Lowest elevation: Lake Maggiore ("Lago Maggiore"), 193 m.a.s (633 feet).</p>
    <p>Time Zone: Central Europe (GMT +1 hour)</p>
    <p>Switzerland is divided in three major geographical areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <p><li type="circle">Alps ("Alpen"): 60%.</li></p>
        <p><li type="circle">Middle land ("Mittelland"): 30%.</li></p>
        <p><li type="circle">Jura: 10%.</li></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mountains</h3>
    <p>Switzerland hosts about 20% of the Alps. Approximately 100 peaks are close to or higher than 4000 meters (13125 feet) above sea level. 
        Many mountain areas are developed, there are trains, cog railways, aerial cable cars and other means of transportation. 
        Swiss mountains are famous for climbing, skiing, snowboarding, biking, hiking and other recreational activities.

    <h3>Lakes</h3>
    <p>Switzerland hosts many lakes, from the large Lake Geneva to hundreds of tiny little lakes in the mountains. 
        There are also many dammed-up lakes, mainly to drive water turbines of power plants.

    <h3>Rivers</h3>
    <p>The rivers of Switzerland lead to three different seas: The Rhein with its tributaries Aare and Thur drains 67.7% of the water into the North Sea. 
        The Rhone and the Ticino (a tributary to the river Po in Italy) drain 18% into the Mediterranean Sea. 
        The Inn (a tributary to the river Donau in Germany/Austria) drains 4.4% into the Black Sea.

    <h3>Climate</h3>
    <p>Switzerland is located in a transition zone. In the west, there is a strong influence of the Atlantic ocean.
        Winds bring a lot of moisture into Switzerland and cause rainfall. 
        In the east, there is an almost continental climate, with lower temperatures and less precipitation.
        On the other hand, the alps - which run from east to west - act as a climatic divide.
        South of the alps, there is an almost Mediterranean climate, with significantly higher temperatures but also a lot of precipitation.
        <br>
        Spring is wet and cool, April is well known for fast and often changing weather conditions.
        Summer is supposed to be warm and dry with maximum temperature up to 35°C (95°F).
        The temperature depends primarily on the elevation, the zero line (0°C or 32°F) may raise as high as 4000 meters above sea level (13125 feet).
        Fall is usually dry, but cool. The temperature will drop significantly in September or October, with the zero line around 2000 meter above sea level (6560 feet).
        Winter is supposed to be cold and dry. The temperature may drop below 0°C everywhere in Switzerland, especially at night.
